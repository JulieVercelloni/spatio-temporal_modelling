Codes associated to the paper "Fine-scale interplay between decline and growth determines the spatial recovery of coral communities within a reef".

First, download the repo on your local machine and open the file "spatio-temporal_modelling.Rproj" from RStudio. Then run the script entitled "model_run.R". 

Note that the model fit is bad in this example as we are using synthetic data (with 50 locations only). 

See Supplementary Material "Details on spatio-temporal modelling" to see model fit and other model diagnostics for checking the model fitted on real data.
