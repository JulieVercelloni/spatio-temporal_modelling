# Spatio-temporal modelling of coral communities 

Codes associated to the paper "Fine-scale interplay between decline and growth determines the spatial recovery of coral communities within a reef".

The model runs using the R package INLA (Rue et al. 2009). 
First, download the repo on your local machine and open the file "spatio-temporal_modelling.Rproj" from RStudio. Then run the script entitled "model_run.R". 

(Note that the model fit is not satisfying in this example because it is using a low number of data locations to speed the model computation. See Supplementary Material "Details on spatio-temporal modelling" to see model fit and other model diagnostics for more information.)
